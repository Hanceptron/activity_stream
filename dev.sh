# KeySpark local dev launcher.

# Starts the backend (FastAPI on :8000, owns the batch scheduler
# and a long-lived Spark session) and the frontend dev server (Vite
# on :5173). The backend is wrapped in run-with-backoff.sh so that if
# its Spark session dies (e.g. after a sleep/wake cycle) it auto-restarts
# with exponential backoff (5s up to 60s), without manual intervention.
#
# The Mac is allowed to sleep and lock normally — no `caffeinate`
# wrappers. The recording agent and streaming job (started by
# `startup-tmux.sh`) each recover from sleep/wake on their own; the
# agent EXITS on macOS wake notifications so a fresh interpreter
# respawns with a working event tap, and the backoff loop catches the
# Spark RPC death.
#
# Ctrl+C cleans both children up.
