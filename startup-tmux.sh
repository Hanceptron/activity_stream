# KeySpark - tmux startup.
#
# Starts the five long-running processes (agent, streaming, backend,
# frontend, watchdog) inside a single detached tmux session named
# "keyspark", each in its own window so logs stay separated.
#
# The Mac is allowed to sleep and lock normally — no `caffeinate`
# wrappers. Every process is wrapped in run-with-backoff.sh, which
# restarts it on exit with exponential backoff (5s up to 60s). On macOS
# wake the agent EXITS on NSWorkspaceDidWakeNotification (pynput's event
# tap is silently killed during sleep and cannot be rebuilt in-process),
# so the backoff loop respawns a fresh interpreter with a working tap.
#
# The backoff loop only covers processes that EXIT. The watchdog window
# (keyspark.watchdog) covers the "alive but wedged" case the backoff loop
# misses: after wake it bounces streaming + backend (whose Spark RPC dies
# on sleep), and it restarts either if their output goes stale. See
# keyspark/watchdog.py.
#
# Usage:
#   ./startup-tmux.sh                       # start everything detached
#   tmux attach -t keyspark              # look at the live logs
#   tmux kill-session -t keyspark        # stop everything
#
# Inside tmux:
#   Ctrl+B then 0-4 - cycle windows (agent, streaming, backend, frontend, watchdog)
#   Ctrl+B then D   - detach without stopping

# UnknownTopicOrPartitionException until the agent produces its first
# event. --if-not-exists makes this idempotent for the common case
# (Kafka was just restarted with the topic intact).

# NOTE: a stale-checkpoint wipe used to live here - on a Kafka offset
# mismatch it ran `rm -rf output/checkpoint output/{metrics,events}/_spark_metadata`.
# That deleted the Structured Streaming commit logs, which orphaned every
# event part file written before the wipe and made the batch silently drop
# weeks of history. It has been removed: streaming_job.py now sets
# failOnDataLoss=false (the Kafka source resets to available offsets instead
# of crashing on a mismatch), and batch_job.py reads output/events as plain
# parquet, independent of the commit log. Never delete _spark_metadata.

# Kill any previous session so this script is idempotent.
